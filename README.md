**Diabetes Help Website**

**Overview**
This is a web-based platform designed to assist users with diabetes-related concerns. This mini project was developed during my 5th semester of engineering. The website consists of three key functionalities:

Diabetes Detection – A machine learning model (Logistic Regression) predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-input health data.

Diabetic Retinopathy Detection – A deep learning model trained on a Kaggle dataset evaluates retinal images to detect signs of diabetic retinopathy.

FAQ Bot – An AI-powered chatbot (GPT-2 Medium) answers diabetes-related questions in real time.
